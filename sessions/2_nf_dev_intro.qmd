title: "Developing bioinformatics workflows with Nextflow"
---

This workshop is designed to provide participants with a fundamental understanding of developing bioinformatics pipelines using nf-core templates. 

### Course Presenters

- Song Li, Bioinformatics Core Facility, Peter Mac
- Richard Lupat, Bioinformatics Core Facility, Peter Mac

### Course Helpers

- Emma Gail, Melbourne Bioinformatics
- Sanduni Rajapaksa, Research Computing Facility, Peter Mac
- Adam Taranto, WEHI

### Prerequisites

- Experience with command line interface and cluster/slurm
- Familiarity with the basic concept of workflows
- Attendance in the ['Introduction to Nextflow and Running nf-core Workflows'](./1_intro_run_nf.qmd) workshop, or an understanding of the Nextflow concepts outlined in the workshop material 

### Learning Objectives:
By the end of this workshop, participants should be able to:

- Learn the structure of nf-core templates
- Develop a basic Nextflow workflow using nf-core templates 
- Re-use and import processes, modules, and sub-workflows into a Nextflow workflow
- Create custom modules using nf-core tools
- Define workflow logic within a workflow script
- Gain an understanding of pipeline version control
