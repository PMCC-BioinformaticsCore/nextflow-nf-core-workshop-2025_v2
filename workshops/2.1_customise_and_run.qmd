### Objectives{.unlisted}

- Run an nf-core pipeline
- Specify different parameters to customise the running of an nf-core pipeline
- Examine output files from an nf-core pipeline
- Customise config files for running an nf-core pipeline

:::

### **2.1.1. Environment setup**

::: {.callout-important collapse="true"}
##### **Institute specific instructions**

Reminder before starting this session, make sure you follow your institute's HPC rulebook re: how to run a workflow manager. 

At Peter Mac HPC, this would mean not running the nextflow pipeline on the login node, load the nextflow & apptainer modules, and set the container cache location (or use the institutional config)

``` default
srun --pty -p <PARTITION> --mem 8GB --mincpus 2 -t 0-5:00 bash

module load nextflow/24.10.5

export NXF_APPTAINER_CACHEDIR="/config/binaries/singularity/containers_devel/nextflow
```
:::

Before we start, please download the test datasets into your home directory 

``` default
git clone --single-branch --branch rnaseq https://github.com/nf-core/test-datasets ~/rnaseq_data
```

And for the purpose of this workshop, we are going to cache the containers by running a test (with a profile) to save time for our processing later

``` default
export NXF_APPTAINER_CACHEDIR="/home/${USER}/apptainer_cache"
nextflow run nf-core/rnaseq -r 3.14.0 -profile test,apptainer --outdir ~/test_rnaseq --max_memory 7.GB --max_cpus 2 
```

Please also create a folder inside our work directory called `lesson2.1` and move into it:

```default
mkdir ./lesson2.1 && cd $_
```

### **2.1.2. Understanding an nf-core pipeline**

The following sections of the nf-core documentation can be used to understand what a particular pipeline is doing, to inform your choices about aspects of pipeline-specific customisations. For this section, we will investigate `nf-core/rnaseq` pipeline.

#### **Pipeline structure**

Looking at the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline structure provided in the [introduction](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/3.14.0), we can see that the developers have:

1. Organised the workflow into 5 stages based on the type of work that is being done
2. Provided a choice of multiple methods and specified defaults
3. Provided a choice of tool for some steps

![](./media/2.1_pipeline-choice.png)

**Quiz**: Observing the diagram above, which statement is true regarding the choice of alignment and quantification methods provided by the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline?
  
**A.** The pipeline uses a fixed method for read alignment and quantification.  
**B.** Users can choose between several different methods for read alignment and quantification.   
**C.** The pipeline always performs read alignment and quantification using STAR or HISAT2.     
**D.** The choice of alignment and quantification method is determined automatically based on the input data.  

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" collapse="true"}
### Solution

The correct answer is **B**. The `nf-core/rnaseq` pipeline allows users to choose between pseudo-alignment and quantification, or genome-based read alignment and quantification. 

* **A.** is incorrect because the pipeline is not limited to a single method.   
* **C.** is incorrect because while read alignment and quantification using STAR is the default method, users can also choose the pseudo-alignment.
* **D.** is also incorrect, as the pipeline only accepts FASTQ files as input, and the choice of alignment and quantification method must be specified by the user.
:::

### **Default pipeline usage**

Typically, nf-core pipelines at a minimum require users to specify a [sample sheet](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/3.14.0/usage#samplesheet-input) (`--input`) detailing the path to your sample data and any relevant metadata. Additionally, if a reference file version is not provided (using the `--genome` parameter), a default [iGenomes](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/blob/master/conf/igenomes.config) one will be used. 

You can see the recommended (typical) run command and all the parameters available for the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline by running:

```default
nextflow run nf-core/rnaseq -r 3.14.0 --help 
```

The typical or recommended run command for this `rnaseq` pipeline is provided at the top of the output: 

![](./media/2.1_default-command.png)

It outlines a requirement for: 

* `--input`: An input samplesheet that contains the data to be processed
* `--outdir`: A location to store outputs 
* `--genome`: Relevant reference data 
* `-profile`: A software management method 

::: {.callout-important}
### **Reminder: hyphens matter in Nextflow!**
**Nextflow**-specific parameters use one (`-`) hyphen, whereas **pipeline**-specific parameters use two (`--`). In the typical run command above `-profile` is a **Nextflow** parameter, while `--input` is a **Nextflow** parameter.
::: 

### **2.1.3. Setting up the run command**

Most of us will need to adjust the default run command for our experiments. Today we'll be adjusting the typical nf-core/rnaseq run command by: 

1. Creating a samplesheet csv, based on the requirements of the pipeline
2. Providing our own reference files
3. Using the `apptainer` software management profile 
4. Customising the execution of some processes 
5. Specifying the computing resource limitations of our session (2 CPUs, 8 GB RAM)

#### **Required parameter: `--input`**

We will create a `samplesheet.csv` based on the documentation provided by [nf-core/rnaseq](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/3.14.0/docs/usage/). 

![](./media/2.1_rnaseq_samplesheet.png)

For `rnaseq`, a `sample` value that specifies the sample name, path to FASTQ files, and `strandedness` is required. 

Since we are only testing the pipeline in this session, we only need to work with a couple of samples. 

```default
sample,fastq_1,fastq_2,strandedness
SRR6357070,../rnaseq_data/testdata/GSE110004/SRR6357070_1.fastq.gz,../rnaseq_data/testdata/GSE110004/SRR6357070_2.fastq.gz,forward
SRR6357071,../rnaseq_data/testdata/GSE110004/SRR6357071_1.fastq.gz,../rnaseq_data/testdata/GSE110004/SRR6357071_2.fastq.gz,forward
```

#### **Required parameter: `--outdir`**

Most nf-core pipelines will require user to specified an output directory to dump all the output files to. 

For this exercise, we will set our output directory to:
``` default
    --outdir ./rnaseq_small_test_outdir
```

#### **Required input: reference data**

Many nf-core pipelines have a minimum requirement for reference data inputs. The input reference data requirements for this pipeline are provided in the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/3.14.0/docs/usage/#reference-genome-options):

![](./media/2.1_reference_files.png)

In the documentation, we see that the recommended method to provide reference files is to explicitly state them using the `--fasta` and `--gtf` parameters. This means we can replace the `--genome` flag in the typical run command with our own files. To see all available reference file parameters, rerun the pipeline's help command to view all the available parameters: 

```default
nextflow run nf-core/rnaseq -r 3.14.0 --help
```

From the **`Reference genome options`** parameters, we will provide our own files using: 

```default
  --fasta ../rnaseq_data/reference/genome.fasta
  --gtf ../rnaseq_data/reference/genes.gtf
```

### **Optional parameters**

Now that we have prepared our input and reference data, we will further customise the typical run command by:

1. Using Nextflow's `-profile` parameter to specify the `apptainer` profile
2. Adding additional process-specific flags to [skip alignment](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/3.14.0/parameters#skip_alignment) and only use [pseudo-aligner](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/3.14.0/parameters#pseudo_aligner)
3. Adding additional max resource flags to specify the [number of CPUs](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/3.14.0/parameters#max_cpus) and [amount of memory](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/3.14.0/parameters#max_memory) available to the pipeline. 

Using the command line, the following parameters can be set:
```default
--skip_alignment true
--pseudo_aligner salmon
```

Inside the [`nextflow.config`](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/blob/3.14.0/nextflow.config), `max_memory` and `max_cpus` have been set to the following:

```default
    max_memory                 = '128.GB'
    max_cpus                   = 16
```

Using the command line, this can be changed with:
```default
--max_memory '6.GB'
--max_cpus 2
```

### **2.1.4. Running the pipeline**

Putting together all the input & parameters that we specified above, the final command will contain our software profile, input samplesheet, output directory, reference files, custom pipeline steps, and custom resources to use. 

```default
nextflow run nf-core/rnaseq -r 3.14.0 \
    -profile apptainer \
    --input samplesheet.csv \
    --outdir ./rnaseq_small_test_outdir \
    --fasta ../rnaseq_data/reference/genome.fasta \
    --gtf ../rnaseq_data/reference/genes.gtf \
    --skip_alignment true \
    --pseudo_aligner salmon \
    --max_memory '6.GB' \
    --max_cpus 2
```

You can see how far we've customised the typical run command from the original example of :
```default
nextflow run nf-core/rnaseq --input samplesheet.csv --genome GRCh37 -profile docker
```

Now that we have prepared our data and chosen which parameters to apply, run the pipeline using the customised command we created above. Take a look at the `stdout` printed to the screen. Your workflow configuration and parameter customisations are all documented here. You can use this to confirm if your parameters have been correctly passed to the run command: 

![Note that this screenshot is only demonstrating the different sections, not necessary the parameters that we have specified above](./media/2.1_nf-core-stdout.png)

As the workflow starts, you will also see a number of processes that are created underneath this. Recall that processes are executed **independently** and can run in **parallel**. Nextflow manages the data dependencies between processes, ensuring that each process is executed only when its input data is available, and all of its dependencies have been satisfied. 

To understand how this is coordinated, consider the `STAR_ALIGN` process. 

![](./media/2.1_nf-core_processes.png)

Notice a few things: 

* We can see which inputs are being processed by looking at the end of the process name
* When a process starts it progressively spawns tasks for all inputs to be processed 
* Two `TRIMGALORE` processes are created, one for each sample in our `samplesheet.csv`. This process has to complete before `STAR_ALIGN` begins 
* Once a `TRIMGALORE` task is completed for a sample, the `STAR_ALIGN` task for that sample begins 
* When the `STAR_ALIGN` process starts, it spawns 2 tasks, one for each sample in our samplesheet

**Exercise**

While we can specify parameters to a pipeline using the command line, this can be messy and result in huge `nextflow run` commands where the parameters we used is not documented. Recall [earlier](./1.2_intro_nf_core.qmd#parameter-files) that a `-params-file` Nextflow parameter can be used to supply parameters to the pipeline.  

Your task: 
Create a a parameter file `workshop-params.yaml`, that contains our customised **pipeline** parameters. How can this file then be used in the `nextflow run` command? (*Note*: **Nextflow** parameters can't be supplied inside a parameter file)

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
### Solution
The parameter file `workshop-params.yaml` should contain the following:

```default
input: "./samplesheet.csv"
outdir: "./rnaseq_small_test_outdir"
fasta: "../rnaseq_data/reference/genome.fasta"
gtf: "../rnaseq_data/reference/genes.gtf"
skip_alignment: true
pseudo_aligner: "salmon"
max_memory: "6.GB"
max_cpus: 2
```
Note that here the **full** path to our reference files is provided. Since `-profile` is a **Nextflow** parameter and not a **pipeline** parameter, it's not listed in the parameter file.  

To run the pipeline using this parameter file, the following command can be used:

```default
nextflow run nf-core/rnaseq -r 3.14.0 \
    -profile apptainer \
    -params-file ./workshop-params.yaml
```
:::

#### **Examine the outputs**

Once your pipeline has completed, you should see this message printed to your terminal:

```default
-[nf-core/rnaseq] Pipeline completed successfully -
Completed at: 27-May-2025 15:25:54
Duration    : 2m 15s
CPU hours   : 0.1
Succeeded   : 20
```

The pipeline ran successfully. 

In the meantime, list (`ls -a`) the contents of your directory, and you'll see new directories (and a hidden directories/files) have been created:

```default
.  ..  .nextflow  .nextflow.log  .nextflow.log.1  rnaseq_small_test_outdir  samplesheet.csv  work  workshop-params.yaml
```
Nextflow has created 2 new output directories, **work** and **rnaseq_small_test_outdir** in the current directory. 

* **The `work` directory**:
  * As each job is ran, a unique sub-directory is created inside the `work` directory. 
  * These directories house temporary files and various command logs created by a process. This contains all the information required when troubleshooting a failed process. 
  
  We will talk in more detail about pipeline troubleshooting later in the next section. 

* **The `rnaseq_small_test_outdir` directory**
  * All final outputs will be presented in a directory specified by the `--outdir` parameter. 
  * Inside this directory, you should have the output files grouped into common tools:
 
  ```default
  .  ..  fastqc  multiqc  pipeline_info  salmon  trimgalore
  ```

**Exercise**

In the previous exercise we have been skipping alignment and only do pseudo-aligner. For this final exercise, your task is to run the same sample but through a different path of the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline. We would use a different output directory for this task `exercise_rnaseq`. 

The additional setting that we need to aim for: 

- Skip picard MarkDuplicates step
- Skip bigwig file creation
- Skip stringtie
- Skip dupradar
- Not doing pseudo alignment
- But keep the alignment step this time 

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
### Solution

```default
nextflow run nf-core/rnaseq -r 3.14.0 \
    -profile apptainer \
    --input samplesheet.csv \
    --outdir ./exercise_rnaseq \
    --fasta ../rnaseq_data/reference/genome.fasta \
    --gtf ../rnaseq_data/reference/genes.gtf \
    --skip_pseudo_alignment \
    --skip_markduplicates \
    --skip_bigwig \
    --skip_stringtie \
    --skip_dupradar \
    --max_memory '6.GB' \
    --max_cpus 2 \
    -resume
```

### **Key points**
- nf-core pipelines contain default settings and required inputs that can be customised. 
- An nf-core pipeline's Usage, Output, and Parameters documentation can be used to design a suitable run command. 
- Parameters can be used to customise the workflow, processes, tools, and compute resources.
