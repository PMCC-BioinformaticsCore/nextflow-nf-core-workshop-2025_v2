Introduction to nf-core: Introduce nf-core features and concepts, structures, tools, and example nf-core pipelines

### **1.2.1. What is nf-core?**

nf-core is a **community** effort to collect a curated set of **analysis workflows** built using Nextflow.

nf-core provides a standardized set of **best practices**, **guidelines**, and **templates** for building and sharing bioinformatics workflows. These workflows are designed to be **modular**, **scalable**, and **portable**, allowing researchers to easily adapt and execute them using their own data and compute resources.

The community is a diverse group of bioinformaticians, developers, and researchers from around the world who collaborate on **developing** and **maintaining** a growing collection of high-quality workflows. These workflows cover a range of applications, including transcriptomics, proteomics, and metagenomics.

One of the key benefits of nf-core is that it promotes **open development**, **testing**, and **peer review**, ensuring that the workflows are robust, well-documented, and validated against real-world datasets. This helps to increase the reliability and reproducibility of bioinformatics analyses and ultimately enables researchers to accelerate their scientific discoveries.

nf-core is published in Nature Biotechnology: [Nat Biotechnol 38, 276–278 (2020). Nature Biotechnology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0439-x)

**Key Features of nf-core workflows**

- **Documentation**
    - nf-core workflows have extensive documentation covering installation, usage, and description of output files to ensure that you won’t be left in the dark.

- **Stable Releases**
    - nf-core workflows use GitHub releases to tag stable versions of the code and software, making workflow runs totally reproducible.

- **Packaged software**
    - Pipeline dependencies are automatically downloaded and handled using Docker, Singularity, Conda, or other software management tools. There is no need for any software installations.

- **Portable and reproducible**
    - nf-core workflows follow best practices to ensure maximum portability and reproducibility. The large community makes the workflows exceptionally well-tested and easy to execute.

- **Cloud-ready**
    - nf-core workflows are tested on AWS

### **1.2.2. Executing an nf-core workflow**

The [nf-core website](https://nf-co.re/) has a full list of workflows and asssociated documentation tno be explored.

Each workflow has a dedicated page that includes expansive documentation that is split into 7 sections:

- **Introduction**
  - An introduction and overview of the workflow
- **Results**
  - Example output files generated from the full test dataset
- **Usage docs**
  - Descriptions of how to execute the workflow
- **Parameters**
  - Grouped workflow parameters with descriptions
- **Output docs**
  - Descriptions and examples of the expected output files
- **Releases & Statistics**
  - Workflow version history and statistics

As nf-core is a community development project the code for a pipeline can be changed at any time. To ensure that you have locked in a specific version of a pipeline you can use Nextflow’s built-in functionality to `pull` a workflow. The Nextflow `pull` command can download and cache workflows from [GitHub](https://github.com/nf-core/) repositories:

```default
nextflow pull nf-core/<pipeline>
```

Nextflow `run` will also automatically `pull` the workflow if it was not already available locally:

```default
nextflow run nf-core/<pipeline>
```

Nextflow will `pull` the default git branch if a workflow version is not specified. This will be the master branch for nf-core workflows with a stable release. nf-core workflows use GitHub releases to tag stable versions of the code and software. You will always be able to execute a previous version of a workflow once it is released using the `-revision` or `-r` flag.

For this section of the workshop we will be using the `nf-core/testpipeline` as an example.

As we will be running some bioinformatics tools, we will need to make sure of the following:

- We are not running on login node
- singularity module is loaded (`module load singularity/3.7.3`)

### **Setup an interactive session**{.unlisted}

```default
srun --pty -p prod_short --mem 20GB --cpus-per-task 2 -t 0-2:00 /bin/bash
```

### **Ensure the required modules are loaded**{.unlisted.}

```default
module list
```

```default
Currently Loaded Modulefiles:
  1) java/jdk-17.0.6      2) nextflow/23.04.1     3) squashfs-tools/4.5   4) singularity/3.7.3
```
:::

We will also create a separate output directory for this section. 
```default
cd /scratch/users/<your-username>/nfWorkshop; mkdir ./lesson1.2 && cd $_
```

The base command we will be using for this section is:
```default
nextflow run nf-core/testpipeline -profile test,singularity --outdir my_results
```

### **1.2.3. Workflow structure**

nf-core workflows start from a **common template** and follow the same structure. Although you won’t need to edit code in the workflow project directory, having a basic understanding of the project structure and some core terminology will help you understand how to configure its execution.

Let's take a look at the code for the [nf-core/rnaseq](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/3.11.1) pipeline.

Nextflow DSL2 **workflows** are built up of **subworkflows** and **modules** that are stored as separate `.nf` files.

Most nf-core workflows consist of a single **workflow** file (there are a few exceptions). This is the main `<workflow>.nf` file that is used to bring everything else together. Instead of having one large monolithic script, it is broken up into a combination of **subworkflows** and **modules**.

A **subworkflow** is a groups of modules that are used in combination with each other and have a common purpose. Subworkflows improve workflow readability and help with the reuse of modules within a workflow. The nf-core community also shares subworkflows in the [nf-core subworkflows GitHub repository](https://github.com/nf-core/modules/tree/master/subworkflows/nf-core). Local subworkflows are workflow specific that are not shared in the nf-core subworkflows repository.


Let's take a look at the [`BAM_STATS_SAMTOOLS`](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/tree/3.11.1/subworkflows/nf-core/bam_stats_samtools) subworkflow.

This subworkflow is comprised of the following modules:
    - [`SAMTOOLS_STATS`](https://github.com/nf-core/modules/blob/master/modules/nf-core/samtools/stats/main.nf)
    - [`SAMTOOLS_IDXSTATS`](https://github.com/nf-core/modules/blob/master/modules/nf-core/samtools/faidx/main.nf), and
    - [`SAMTOOLS_FLAGSTAT`](https://github.com/nf-core/modules/blob/master/modules/nf-core/samtools/flagstat/main.nf)

A **module** is a wrapper for a process, most modules will execute a single tool and contain the following definitions:
    - [inputs](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#inputs)
    - [outputs](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#outputs), and
    - [script](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#script) block.

Like subworkflows, modules can also be shared in the [nf-core modules GitHub repository](https://github.com/nf-core/modules/tree/master/modules/nf-core) or stored as a local module. All modules from the nf-core repository are version controlled and tested to ensure reproducibility. Local modules are workflow specific that are not shared in the nf-core modules repository.

### **1.2.4. Viewing parameters**

Every nf-core workflow has a full list of **parameters** on the nf-core website. When viewing these parameters online, you will also be shown a description and the type of the parameter. Some parameters will have additional text to help you understand when and how a parameter should be used.

[![](./media/1.3_params.excalidraw.png)](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/3.11.1/parameters)

Parameters and their descriptions can also be viewed in the command line using the `run` command with the `--help` parameter:

```default
nextflow run nf-core/<workflow> --help
``` 

::: callout-tip

### **Challenge**{.unlisted}

View the parameters for the `nf-core/testpipeline` workflow using the command line:

:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}

### Solution

The `nf-core/testpipeline` workflow parameters can be printed using the `run` command and the `--help` option:

```default
nextflow run nf-core/testpipeline --help
```

:::

### **1.2.5. Parameters in the command line**

Parameters can be customized using the command line. Any parameter can be configured on the command line by prefixing the parameter name with a double dash (`--`):

```default
nextflow run nf-core/<workflow> --<parameter>
```

::: callout-tip

Nextflow options are prefixed with a single dash (`-`) and workflow parameters are prefixed with a double dash (`--`).

:::

Depending on the parameter type, you may be required to add additional information after your parameter flag. For example, for a string parameter, you would add the string after the parameter flag:

```default
nextflow run nf-core/<workflow> --<parameter> string
```

::: callout-tip

### **Challenge**{.unlisted}

Give the MultiQC report for the `nf-core/testpipeline` workflow the name of your **favorite animal** using the [`multiqc_title`](https://github.com/nf-core/testpipeline/blob/master/nextflow.config#L27) parameter using a command line flag:

:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}

### Solution

Add the `--multiqc_title` flag to your command and execute it. Use the `-resume` option to save time:

```default
nextflow run nf-core/testpipeline -profile test,singularity --multiqc_title koala --outdir my_results -resume
```
:::

In this example, you can check your parameter has been applied by listing the files created in the results folder (`my_results`):

```default
ls my_results/multiqc/
```

### **1.2.6. Configuration files**

Configuration files are `.config` files that can contain various workflow properties. Custom paths passed in the command-line using the `-c` option:

```default
nextflow run nf-core/<workflow> -profile test,docker -c <path/to/custom.config>
```

Multiple custom `.config` files can be included at execution by separating them with a comma (`,`).

Custom configuration files follow the same structure as the configuration file included in the workflow directory. Configuration properties are organized into [scopes](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html#config-scopes) by grouping the properties in the same scope using the curly brackets notation. For example:

```default
alpha {
     x = 1
     y = 'string value..'
}
```

Scopes allow you to quickly configure settings required to deploy a workflow on different infrastructure using different software management. For example, the `executor` scope can be used to provide settings for the deployment of a workflow on a HPC cluster. Similarly, the `singularity` scope controls how Singularity containers are executed by Nextflow. Multiple scopes can be included in the same `.config` file using a mix of dot prefixes and curly brackets. A full list of scopes is described in detail [here](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html#config-scopes).

::: callout-tip

### **Challenge**{.unlisted}

Give the MultiQC report for the `nf-core/testpipeline` workflow the name of your favorite color using the [`multiqc_title`](https://github.com/nf-core/testpipeline/blob/master/nextflow.config#L27) parameter in a custom `my_custom.config` file:

:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}

### Solution

Create a custom `my_custom.config` file that contains your favourite colour, e.g., blue:

```default
params {
    multiqc_title = "blue"
}
```

Include the custom `.config` file in your execution command with the `-c` option:

```default
nextflow run nf-core/testpipeline --outdir my_results -profile test,singularity -resume -c my_custom.config
```

Check that it has been applied:

```default
ls my_results/multiqc/
```

**Why did this fail?**

You **can not** use the `params` scope in custom configuration files. Parameters can only be configured using the `-params-file` option and the command line. While parameter is listed as a parameter on the `STDOUT`, it **was not** applied to the executed command.

We will revisit this at the end of the module

:::

### **1.2.7 Parameter files**
Parameter files are used to define `params` options for a pipeline, generally written in the YAML format. They are added to a pipeline with the flag `--params-file`

Example YAML:
```default
"<parameter1_name>": 1,
"<parameter2_name>": "<string>",
"<parameter3_name>": true
```

::: callout-tip

### **Challenge**{.unlisted}

Based on the failed application of the parameter `multiqc_title` create a `my_params.yml` setting `multiqc_title` to your favourite colour.
Then re-run the pipeline with the your `my_params.yml`

:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}

### Solution
Set up `my_params.yml`

```default
multiqc_title: "black"
```

```default
nextflow run nf-core/testpipeline -profile test,singularity --params-file my_params.yml --outdir Lesson1_2
```

:::

### **1.2.8. Default configuration files**

All parameters will have a default setting that is defined using the `nextflow.config` file in the workflow project directory. By default, most parameters are set to `null` or `false` and are only activated by a profile or configuration file.

There are also several `includeConfig` statements in the `nextflow.config` file that are used to load additional `.config` files from the `conf/` folder. Each additional `.config` file contains categorized configuration information for your workflow execution, some of which can be optionally included:

- `base.config`
  - Included by the workflow by default.
  - Generous resource allocations using labels.
  - Does not specify any method for software management and expects software to be available (or specified elsewhere).
- `igenomes.config`
  - Included by the workflow by default.
  - Default configuration to access reference files stored on [AWS iGenomes](https://ewels.github.io/AWS-iGenomes/).
- `modules.config`
  - Included by the workflow by default.
  - Module-specific configuration options (both mandatory and optional).

Notably, configuration files can also contain the definition of one or more profiles. A profile is a set of configuration attributes that can be activated when launching a workflow by using the `-profile` command option:

```default
nextflow run nf-core/<workflow> -profile <profile>
```

Profiles used by nf-core workflows include:

- **Software management profiles**
  - Profiles for the management of software using software management tools, e.g., `docker`, `singularity`, and `conda`.
- **Test profiles**
  - Profiles to execute the workflow with a standardized set of test data and parameters, e.g., `test` and `test_full`.

Multiple profiles can be specified in a comma-separated (`,`) list when you execute your command. The order of profiles is important as they will be read from left to right:

```default
nextflow run nf-core/<workflow> -profile test,singularity
```

nf-core workflows are required to define **software containers** and **conda environments** that can be activated using profiles.

::: callout-tip

If you're computer has internet access and one of Conda, Singularity, or Docker installed, you should be able to run any nf-core workflow with the `test` profile and the respective software management profile 'out of the box'. The `test` data profile will pull small test files directly from the `nf-core/test-data` GitHub repository and run it on your local system. The `test` profile is an important control to check the workflow is working as expected and is a great way to trial a workflow. Some workflows have multiple test `profiles` for you to test.
