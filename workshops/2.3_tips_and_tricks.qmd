### **2.3.1. Running Nextflow Pipelines on a HPC **

Nextflow, by default, spawns parallel task executions wherever it is running. You can use [Nextflow's executors](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/executor.html) feature to run these tasks using an HPC job schedulers such as [SLURM](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/executor.html#slurm) and [PBS Pro](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/executor.html#pbs-pro). Use a custom configuration file to send all processes to the job scheduler as separate jobs and define essential resource requests like `cpus`, `time`, `memory`, and `queue` inside a `process {}` [scope](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#processes). 

#### **Run all workflow tasks as separate jobs on HPC**

In this custom configuration file we have sent all tasks that a workflow is running to a PBS Pro job scheduler and specified jobs to be run on the normal queue, each running for a max time of 3 hours with 1 cpu and 4 Gb of memory:

```default
process {
  executor = 'slurm'
  queue = 'prod_short'
  cpus = 1
  time = '2h'
  memory = '4.GB'
}
```

#### **Run processes with different resource profiles as HPC jobs**

Adjusting the custom configuration file above, we can use the `withName {}` [process selector](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html?highlight=withname#process-selectors) to specify process-specific resource requirements:

```default
process {
  executor = 'slurm'
	
  withName processONE {
    queue = 'prod_short'
    cpus = 1
    time = '2h'
    memory = '4.GB'
  }

  withName processTWO {
    queue = 'prod_med'
    cpus = 2
    time = '10h'
    memory = '50.GB'
  }
}
```

#### **Specify infrastructure-specific directives for your jobs**

Adjusting the custom configuration file above, we can define any native configuration options using the [clusterOptions](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#process-clusteroptions) directive. We can use this to specify non-standard resources. Below we have specified which HPC project code to bill for all process jobs:

You can also setup a config to tailor specific to Peter Mac's HPC partitions setup. 

```default
executor {
    queueSize         = 100
    queueStatInterval = '1 min'
    pollInterval      = '1 min'
    submitRateLimit   = '20 min'
}

process {
    executor = 'slurm'
    cache    = 'lenient'
    beforeScript = 'module load singularity'
    stageInMode = 'symlink'
    queue = { task.time < 2.h ? 'prod_short' : task.time < 24.h ? 'prod_med' : 'prod' } 
}
```

### **Challenge**{.unlisted}

Run the previous nf-core/rnaseq workflow using the `process` and `executor` scope above (in a config file), and send each task to slurm. 

:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}

### Solution

Create a nextflow.config file

```default
process.executor = 'slurm'
```

Run the nfcore/rna-seq workflow again
```
nextflow run nf-core/rnaseq -r 3.11.1 \
    -params-file workshop-params.yaml
    -profile singularity \
    --max_memory '6.GB' \
    --max_cpus 2 \
    -resume 
```

Did you get the following error? 

``` default
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Access/permission denied
```

Try running the same workflow on login-node and observe the difference

```default
>>> squeue -u rlupat -i 5

          17429286      prod nf-NFCOR   rlupat  R       0:03      1 papr-res-compute01
```

### **2.3.3. Clean your work directory**

Your work directory can get very big very quickly (especially if you are using full sized datasets). It is good practise to `clean` your work directory regularly. Rather than removing the `work` folder with all of it's contents, the Nextflow `clean` function allows you to selectively remove data associated with specific runs.

```default
nextflow clean -help
```

The `-after`, `-before`, and `-but` options are all very useful to select specific runs to `clean`. The `-dry-run` option is also very useful to see which files will be removed if you were to `-force` the `clean` command.

::: callout-tip

### **Challenge**{.unlisted}

You Nextflow to `clean` your work `work` directory of staged files but **keep** your execution logs.

:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}

### Solution

Use the Nextflow `clean` command with the `-k` and `-f` options:

```default
nextflow clean -k -f
```

### **2.3.4. Change default Nextflow cache strategy**

Workflow execution is [sometimes not resumed as expected](https://training.nextflow.io/basic_training/cache_and_resume/#resume-troubleshootingl). The [default behaviour of Nextflow cache keys](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#cache) is to index the input files meta-data information. Reducing the cache stringency to `lenient` means the files cache keys are based only on filesize and path, and can help to avoid unexpectedly re-running certain processes when `-resume` is in use. 

To apply lenient cache strategy to all of your runs, you could add to a custom configuration file:

```default
process {
    cache = 'lenient'
}
```

You can specify different cache stategies for different processes by using `withName` or `withLabel`. You can specify a particular cache strategy be applied to certain `profiles` within your institutional config, or to apply to all profiles described within that config by placing the above `process` code block outside the `profiles` scope.    



### **2.3.5. Access private GitHub repositories**

To interact with private repositories on GitHub, you can provide Nextflow with [access to GitHub](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/sharing.html#github-credentials) by specifying your GitHub user name and a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) in the [`scm` configuration file](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/sharing.html#scm-configuration-file) inside your specified `.nextflow/` directory:

```default
providers {

  github {
    user = 'rlupat'
    password = 'my-personal-access-token'
  }

}
```
