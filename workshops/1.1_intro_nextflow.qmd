### **1.1.1. What is a Workflow?**

A workflow is a sequence of steps or processes through which a piece of work passes [^1]. These steps may be dependent on other tasks to complete, or they can be run in parallel. 

<img src="media/01_1_1_WorkflowMockUp.png" width="200">

In bioinformatics workflows, each step would commonly comprises of a computation tool that operates on some input files to produce output files. A workflow can be as simple as many command line tools chained together to facilitate complex data manipulations.  

![](media/01_1_2_WorkflowExample.png)

A simple script like this example above would likely be adequate to prototype a workflow for a once-off analysis. However, there are many other considerations to take into account when turning this into an efficient and scalable computational workflow. For example: 

- How do we remove unneeded intermediate files? 
- How do we handle tool installations, versions, and dependencies? 
- How do we submit each of these jobs into a job scheduler (e.g Slurm) in a High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster? 
- How do we resume a partially failed workflow, especially if some of the initial completed tasks take long to compute? 
- How do we capture the log outputs from each tool? 
- How do we monitor how far the workflow has progressed? 
- How do we share this workflow? 

Some of these considerations are the primary reasons why people choose to use a workflow system to orchestrate and deploy their computational workflows. There are many [existing workflow systems](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/common-workflow-language/wiki/Existing-Workflow-systems), and Nextflow is one of them.  

### **1.1.2. What is Nextflow?**

Nextflow is a commonly used workflow system used to build scalable, portable, and reproducible computational workflows. 

It addresses the considerations that we discussed, providing features such as: 

- Scalability, portability, and reproducibility
- Ease of workflow deployment and sharing
- Execution abstraction between workflow logic and execution system 

Nextflow implements its own **domain-specific language (DSL)**, which extends from the Groovy programming language (a derivation of Java).  

You will notice there are libraries and functions used in Nextflow workflows that are still written in the native Groovy script. 

### **1.1.3. Processes and Channels**

In Nextflow, **processes** and **channels** are the fundamental building blocks of a workflow.

A **process** is a unit of execution that represents a single computational step in a workflow. It typically performs one specific task, and specifies its input and outputs and any directives required for its execution. Processe scripts can be written in any language that can be executed from the command line, such as Bash, Python, or R.

```default
process sayHello {
  input: 
    val x
  output:
    stdout
  script:
    """
    echo '$x world!'
    """
}
```
In the above example, the process called `sayHello` takes one input variable `x`, prints the value that is input into the process with `world!`, and outputs the standard output `stdout`. In this example, Bash is used inside the `script` block. This is the default `script` language used in Nextflow. 

Processes can also be **parameterized**, allowing for flexibility in their behaviour and to enable their reuse in the same workflow, and between different workflows. Processes are executed independently (i.e., they do not share a common writable state) as **tasks** and can run in parallel, allowing for efficient utilization of computing resources. Nextflow automatically manages the data dependencies between processes, ensuring that each process is executed only when its input data is available and all of its dependencies have been satisfied.

A **channel** is an asynchronous first-in, first-out (FIFO) queue that is used to join processes together. 

![](media/01_1_3_Channel_Process.png)

Channels allow data to be passed between processes, and can be used to manage data, parallelize tasks, and structure workflows. A process can define one or more channels as an input and output. Ultimately, the workflow execution itself is implicitly defined by these declarations.

```default
Channel.of('Bonjour', 'Ciao', 'Hello', 'Hola') 
    .set { ch_input }

ch_output = sayHello(ch_input)
```
In this example, four strings `Bonjour`, `Ciao`, `Hello`, `Hola` are assiged to a channel `ch_input`. This channel is then input to the `sayHello` process, where each element in the channel creates separate tasks that are executed in parallel. The output of the process is assigned to a channel `ch_output`. 

### **1.1.4. Execution abstraction**

While a process defines what command or script is executed, the **executor** determines how and where the script is executed.

Nextflow provides an **abstraction** between the workflow’s functional logic and the underlying execution system. This allows users to define a workflow once and execute it on different computing platforms without having to modify the workflow. Nextflow provides a variety of built-in execution options (eg. locally, HPC cluster, and cloud-based), and allows users to easily switch between these options using command-line arguments.

![](media/01_1_4_AbstractionExec.png)

If not specified, processes are executed on your local computer, which is useful for workflow development and testing purposes. However, for real-world computational workflows, an HPC or cloud-based platform is often required.

You can find a full list of supported executors as well as how to configure them [here](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/executor.html).

### **1.1.5. Nextflow CLI**

Nextflow provides a robust command line interface for the management and execution of workflows. Nextflow can be used on any POSIX compatible system (Linux, OS X, etc), and requires Bash 3.2 (or later) and Java 11 (or later, up to 18) to be installed.

Nextflow has been pre-installed in our workshop environment virtual machines. However, in your institutes' HPC, a command to load nextflow might be different. 

::: {.callout-important collapse="true"}
##### **Institute specific instructions**
To load nextflow at Peter Mac HPC for example, you can do `module load nextflow/24.10.5`
:::


::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
##### **How to install Nextflow**
Nextflow is distributed as a self-installing package and does not require any special installation procedure.

1. Download the executable package using either `wget -qO- https://get.nextflow.io | bash` or `curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash`
2. Make the binary executable on your system by running `chmod +x nextflow`.
3. Move the `nextflow` file to a directory accessible by your `$PATH` variable, e.g, `mv nextflow ~/bin/`
:::

### **1.1.6.Nextflow options and commands**

Nextflow provides a robust command line interface for the management and execution of workflows. The top-level interface consists of options and commands.

You can list Nextflow options and commands with the `-h` option:

```default
nextflow -h
```

```default
Usage: nextflow [options] COMMAND [arg...]

Options:
  -C
     Use the specified configuration file(s) overriding any defaults
  -D
     Set JVM properties
  -bg
     Execute nextflow in background
  -c, -config
     Add the specified file to configuration set
  -config-ignore-includes
     Disable the parsing of config includes
  -h
     Print this help
  -log
     Set nextflow log file path
  -q, -quiet
     Do not print information messages
  -remote-debug
     Enable JVM interactive remote debugging (experimental)
  -syslog
     Send logs to syslog server (eg. localhost:514)
  -trace
     Enable trace level logging for the specified package name - multiple packages can be provided separating them with a comma e.g. '-trace nextflow,io.seqera'
  -v, -version
     Print the program version

Commands:
  clean         Clean up project cache and work directories
  clone         Clone a project into a folder
  config        Print a project configuration
  console       Launch Nextflow interactive console
  drop          Delete the local copy of a project
  help          Print the usage help for a command
  info          Print project and system runtime information
  inspect       Inspect process settings in a pipeline project
  kuberun       Execute a workflow in a Kubernetes cluster (experimental)
  list          List all downloaded projects
  log           Print executions log and runtime info
  plugin        Execute plugin-specific commands
  pull          Download or update a project
  run           Execute a pipeline project
  secrets       Manage pipeline secrets
  self-update   Update nextflow runtime to the latest available version
  view          View project script file(s)
```

Options for each Nextflow command can also be viewed by appending the `-help` option. Note that there is only **one** dash in the `-help` option. 

``` default 
nextflow run -help
```

### **1.1.7. Managing your environment**

You can also use [environment variables](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html#environment-variables) to control the Nextflow runtime and the underlying Java virtual machine. These variables can be exported before running a workflow and will be interpreted by Nextflow.

Since we are using shared storage, we should consider storing shared software in a location that is accessible by all users in the cluster. The key Nextflow environment variables to do this is `NXF_APPTAINER_CACHEDIR` for Apptainer, `NXF_SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR` for Singularity, and `NXF_CONDA_CACHEDIR` for Conda environment managers. 

For this workshop, we will be using apptainer as our container tool. As all users have their individual VMs, we will set the `NXF_APPTAINER_CACHEDIR` to `~/apptainer_cache`. 

```default
export NXF_APPTAINER_CACHEDIR="~/apptainer_cache"
```

::: {.callout-important collapse="true"}
##### **Institute specific instructions**
At Peter Mac HPC, you would set this variable to:

```default
export NXF_APPTAINER_CACHEDIR="/config/binaries/singularity/containers_devel/nextflow
```
:::


Images downloaded by workflow executions will now be stored in this directory.

### **1.1.8. Executing a workflow**

Nextflow also enables users to run workflows hosted in a remote code repository such as [GitHub](https://github.com/), by specifying the repository URL or its qualified name. For example, if a Nextflow project `bar` is hosted in a GitHub repository `foo` at the address `http://github.com/foo/bar`, it could be run using either:

```default
nextflow run foo/bar

nextflow run http://github.com/foo/bar
```

As our first exercise, we will execute the `hello` workflow directly from `nextflow-io` [GitHub](https://github.com/nextflow-io/hello) repository. Start by creating a directory `lesson1.1`. 

```default
mkdir ./lesson1.1 && cd $_
```
**Exercise**: Use the `nextflow run` command to run the pipeline using the qualified name.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
### **Solution**

```default
nextflow run nextflow-io/hello
```

```default
N E X T F L O W  ~  version 23.04.1
Launching `https://github.com/nextflow-io/hello` [deadly_hoover] DSL2 - revision: 1d71f857bb [master]
executor >  local (4)
[a2/9c17c8] process > sayHello (2) [100%] 4 of 4 ✔
Hello world!

Bonjour world!

Hola world!

Ciao world!
```
:::

If you `run` a workflow, it will look for a local file with the workflow name you’ve specified. If that file does not exist, it will look for a public repository with the same name on GitHub (unless otherwise specified). If it is found, Nextflow will automatically `pull` the workflow to your global cache and execute it.

Be aware of what is already in your current working directory where you launch your workflow, if there are other workflows (or configuration files) you may encounter unexpected results.


::: {.callout-caution}
#### **Should I be running Nextflow on login node? **{.unlisted}

Short answer, no! Even though nextflow is not performing any heavy computation, without the necessary execution configurations, all the processes within the workflow will be executed locally.

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
##### **Institute specific instructions**
At Peter Mac HPC, we would run a nextflow job inside an sbatch job; or via an interactive slurm job`

``` default
srun --pty -p <PARTITION> --mem 8GB --mincpus 2 -t 0-5:00 bash
```
