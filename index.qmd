title: "Intro to Nextflow Workshop"
---

These workshops are designed to provide participants with a foundational understanding of Nextflow and nf-core pipelines. Participants are expected to have prior experience with the command-line interface and working with cluster systems like Slurm. The primary goal of the workshop is to equip researchers with the skills needed to use nextflow and nf-core pipelines for their research data.
